# Variables

### What is a variable?
A varaible is representation of information.
<br>
In order to access and process an information, it needs to be stored, that's where variables come in.
It is used for storing information.
<br>
In C# there are different types of variable, we need to specify variable types, 
one variable type will not necessarily be compatible with another variable type.
<br>
Variable types have reserved keywords which canot be used for any other purposes.<br>
Type tells us what kind of data it will store,<br>
for example, <br>
"int" will store integer data (numbers), <br>
"string" allows us to store textual information (string myName = "Ashwin"),<br>
"bool" allows us to store boolean values ("true/false" OR "0/1")<br>
<br>
Variable names should be meaningful, which identifies the purpose of that variable,<br>
for example, storing count of the number of books, then the variable should be "countOfBooks".<br>
<br>
We can convert variable types,<br>
for example,<br>
string number = "2";<br>
int numberConverted = Convert.ToInt32(number);<br>
<br>
Console.Writeline() can be used to print the variable values in console.
