## Definitions - 
 
### Expressions
An expression is a series of operators and oprands.

### Operators
They are the symbols that represent an operation which returns a single result.
<br>
for example, plus, minus, multiplication, division, assignment, eqality checks, etc.

### Operands
Operands are the inputs for the operators. Operands are data elements that are used as inputs for operators.
<br>
for example,
<br>
```
int simpleExpression = 5 - 7

/*
5 & 7 are operands (inputs), 

"-" is an operator and "5 - 7" is an expression, once the operation finishes, it will give a single result, 

"=" is the assignment operator whic.
*/
```

Expressions can be combined into more complex expressions and the way it is combined is through operators.
